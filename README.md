# Health Centre

I was tasked with making a webpage for the receptionist for this website. To save in a mySQL database, he or she needs to be able to create a patient, a doctor, and an appointment. The researcher needs to schedule a visit with current physicians and patients.  For my project, I used MAMP. I'll go over the download sequence below.

## Installation

1. Install MAMP or XAMPP:
   - For MAMP: Download the MAMP installer from the official MAMP website (https://www.mamp.info/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
   - For XAMPP: Download the XAMPP installer from the official XAMPP website (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
```
https://github.com/EmilioCarreiraOWI/Carreira_Emilio_221350_DV200_Term_2_Project.git
```
4. Move the project files to the web server's document root directory. For MAMP, the document root is typically located at `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`. For XAMPP, it is typically located at `C:\xampp\htdocs\`.

## Usage

1. Start MAMP or XAMPP:
   - For MAMP: Open the MAMP application and click on the "Start Servers" button. This will start the Apache and MySQL servers.
   - For XAMPP: Open the XAMPP Control Panel and click on the "Start" button next to Apache and MySQL.

2. Open a web browser and enter `http://localhost` in the address bar.
3. The project should now be accessible in the web browser.

## Contributing

I intend to improve the website in the future, but I was unable to implement all of its functionality. A page may update or delete an appointment, depending on the page.
